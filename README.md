### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Adel Qudsi and I'm a fullstack software engineer based in New York City, with strong experience developing web applications that utilize React.js, Redux, Ruby on Rails, D3 and PostgreSQL.

I recently finished a 1000+ hour bootcamp at App Academy, a full-stack web development course with less than 5% acceptance rate where I spent over 80 hours week studying and perfecting my skills in different technologies

My other skillsets include: JQuery, AWS, Express, MongoDB, Javascript, HTML5, Node, CSS. 

When I'm not working on my software engineering skills, I'm rooting for my favorite sport teams #LGM, planning my next camping trip, and challenging my mind with strategy based games. A deep passion for all things board games.

Lets talk all things coding over your favorite board game.

Feel free to shoot me an email at Qudsi.Adel@gmail.com
